# executable-file-for-macro
Executable VBScript file for runs the macro


There is an Excel Macro File with a macro called "Cycle".
The macro runs on all csv files in a specific folder ('''strDirPath'') and cleans them.
This is all on a Windows machine.
 
Our mission has two elements:
1. Create an executable file that upon activation runs the macro.
2. If possible, the executable file asks the user for input â€“ the files' folder path, so the macro runs on all files in that specific folder.
 
There are following:
1. Two different CSV files as an example for the files before cleanup.
2. The macro book ''Macro-Workbook''. Inside there is a macro called "Cycle"
